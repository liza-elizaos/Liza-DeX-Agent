/**
 * REAL PUMP.FUN API DOCUMENTATION
 * 
 * The issue: We were using wrong API endpoint
 * PumpPortal is for trading, not creation!
 * 
 * CORRECT API for REAL token creation:
 * 1. Upload metadata to IPFS  
 * 2. Use Pump.fun's launchToken API endpoint
 * 3. OR use direct smart contract interaction
 * 
 * The fake mint "memPO5ME2SCQV" means:
 * - API call was failing silently
 * - Our code returned success anyway
 * - We need to properly validate responses
 * 
 * SOLUTION: Use web3.js to create REAL SPL token
 * OR use correct Pump.fun API (if available)
 * 
 * Resources:
 * - Solana SPL: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library
 * - Create token: web3.js (not Pump.fun API)
 * - Pump.fun: https://pump.fun/docs

🔍 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:

Current Issue:
✗ Mock mint addresses: "memPO5ME2SCQV" (15 chars)
✗ Real mints: Should be 43-44 chars base58
✗ API silently failing

Root Cause:
- Pump.fun FREE API might not support token CREATION
- Only supports TRADING on existing tokens
- We need REAL token creation

SOLUTION OPTIONS:

Option 1: Use Solana web3.js (REAL SPL Token)
- Create SPL token directly on blockchain
- Uses private key from environment
- Costs: 0.00184 SOL (rent) + TX fee
- Result: REAL token immediately on Solana

Option 2: Use correct Pump.fun endpoint (if exists)
- Need to find correct launchToken API
- May require different authentication
- Check Pump.fun docs

Option 3: Smart Contract (m4rcu5o)
- Deploy on-chain
- Then use that contract
- More control

RECOMMENDATION:
Go with Option 1: Direct Solana web3.js SPL token creation
- We have private key already
- Works 100%
- Real tokens guaranteed
- Just need funding wallet
